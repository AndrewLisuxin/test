git checkout [<tree-ish>] --[path]: will restore working tree with tree-ish(eg: HEAD) or index if no tree-ish specified.

checkout: must restore working tree (changes not committed)
	1. if changes have not been staged, we can use index to override working tree:  checkout -- file
	2. if changes have been staged but not been committed, we can use HEAD(last commit) to override working tree.
	Notice the 3-tier structure:
		working tree <--> staging area <--> local repository
		staging area will be overriden before working tree.
